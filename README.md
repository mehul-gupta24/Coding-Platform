## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user registration and login with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for access/refresh tokens and bcrypt for password hashing. Supports role-based access (e.g., user for solving, admin for problem management) and guest access via "Continue without login" for instant exploration. Refresh tokens ensure seamless session persistence.
- **Variety of Problems**: A rich library of coding problems across difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and topics (e.g., data structures, algorithms, system design), stored in the `problems` folder of a GitHub repository. Fetched dynamically via the GitHub API, enabling collaborative updates and scalability without database overhead.
- **Category-Wise Algorithms to Learn**: Structured learning paths in the `algorithms` folder, covering categories like arrays, linked lists, graphs, and dynamic programming. Each category includes detailed explanations, sample solutions, and curated problem sets to support systematic learning for coding interviews and competitive programming.
- **Problem Solving with Multiple Languages**: Solve problems in various languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, C++, Java) using a Monaco/Ace editor with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time feedback. Submissions are evaluated against hidden test cases via Judge0, providing detailed pass/fail results per test case.
- **Track User Progress**: A comprehensive dashboard, accessible via the **Profile** section in the top-right corner, tracks solved problems, submission history, success rates, and performance metrics (e.g., runtime, memory usage). Data is persisted in MongoDB, offering insights like problem-solving streaks, category-wise completion rates, and personalized recommendations.
- **Playground to Run Custom Code**: A dedicated coding environment in the Playground page for writing, testing, and debugging custom code snippets with user-defined inputs. Code is saved in browser local storage for persistence across sessions, distinct from problem submissions, and leverages Judge0 for secure execution.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React for Frontend (`client` Folder)**: Built with React and Vite in the `client` folder for a fast, responsive single-page application (SPA). Features modular components for problem listings, dashboards, profile pages, and a Monaco/Ace editor with code folding, error highlighting, and theme support, ensuring an intuitive coding experience across devices.
- **MongoDB + JWT + bcrypt for Authentication and Progress (`server` Folder)**: MongoDB, managed via Mongoose in the `server` folder, stores user profiles, submission histories, and progress data with efficient indexing for fast queries. JWT handles secure access/refresh tokens, while bcrypt ensures robust password hashing for a secure, scalable user management system.
- **GitHub as a Static Store for Problems and Algorithms (`problems` & `algorithms` Folders)**: Problems and algorithm tutorials are stored in the `problems` and `algorithms` folders of a GitHub repository, fetched via the GitHub API. This version-controlled, static storage offers high availability, collaborative maintenance through pull requests, and eliminates traditional database needs for content.
- **Local Storage for Code Saving (Client-Side)**: Browser local storage persists user code drafts in the editor and playground, enabling auto-save and session recovery without server-side storage, reducing backend load and enhancing usability for iterative coding.
- **Judge0 API for Code Execution (Server-Side Integration)**: Integrates Judge0 for secure, sandboxed code execution, supporting multiple languages with strict time/memory limits (e.g., 2s, 256MB). Hosted Judge0 ensures scalability, reliability, and minimal latency for concurrent submissions with robust error reporting.
- **Render Hosting for Frontend and Backend**: The frontend (`client`) and backend (`server`) are deployed on Render, leveraging managed hosting for automatic scaling, zero-downtime deploys, and simplified CI/CD. Render ensures high availability and secure configuration via environment variables.

```

- **Client (Frontend - `client` folder)**: React SPA hosted on Render as a Static Site, using local storage for code persistence. Handles UI rendering, editor integration, profile page access, and API requests for authentication, problem fetching, and submissions.
- **Server (Backend - `server` folder)**: Express.js on Render as a Web Service, managing API endpoints for user auth, progress tracking, and code execution. Proxies requests to GitHub and Judge0, storing dynamic data in MongoDB.
- **Problems & Algorithms (`problems` & `algorithms` folders)**: Stored in a GitHub repository, fetched via API for versioned, scalable content storage. Supports collaborative updates and eliminates database bloat.
- **Contests (`contests` folder)**: Stores contest metadata and submissions (if implemented), integrating with the submission flow for timed challenges.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Managed database for user profiles, submissions, and progress, with indexes for efficient queries (e.g., userId, problemId).
- **Judge0 API**: External service for secure code execution, handling multiple languages in isolated sandboxes with strict resource limits.
- **Render Hosting**: Hosts both frontend and backend, providing auto-scaling, HTTPS, and environment variable management.
